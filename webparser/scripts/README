dont forget to ./manage.py syncdb and ./manage.py migrate
'sudo apt-get install python-dev libmysqlclient-dev' FOR MYSQL
You'll need the python extension ,BeautifulSoup 4.1.2, or higher
as it supports searching html's class tags

set up the environment and settle dependencies
check the requirements.txt

1. In main.py, provide the call to SoupParser.Parser() or DeptParser.Dept()
SoupParser:
provide a source (.html or URL), the type (0 for html, 1 for URL) of the course, and file prefix(for saved output)
course urls look like this https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/dispatcher/schedule/2014/fall/ACE/100
DeptParser:
provide a source (.txt[not yet implemented] or URL) of a list of courses (dept number), the type (0 for .txt, 1 for URL),
and a file prefix(for saved output) [not yet implemented. does nothing currently]
list of courses look like this https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/dispatcher/catalog/2014/spring/ACE

Start the virtualenv
and run the command './manage.py runscript main' from the django app folder
django will connect to the database using the information in settings.py
and save course information to database

In SoupParser, there is a function (print_pretty) for pretty printing the html
there is a option within the get_course function for printing contents to a file.
just put the print statements back in, remove the status print statements, and allow switching std outputs
