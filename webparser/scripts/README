You'll need the python extension ,BeautifulSoup 4.1.2, or higher
as it supports searching html's class tags

1. In main.py, provide the call to SoupParser.Parser()
with the source (.html or URL), the type (0 for html, 1 for URL), and file prefix(for saved output)
2. Then just run python ./main.py
    the script will generate a pretty printed version of the html
    with suffix _pretty to /pretty_html
    it will also save output to a text file with suffix _parsed.txt to
    /parsed_txt
